# PHYS-203-Final-Project
Xander Naumenko and Oliver Tong

This is the final project for our PHYS 203 project, in which we were to make a numerical simulation of a thermodynamic system. For this project we chose to make a simplified model of the Earth's climate system. We assume that the only gases are CO2 and water vapour, and we incorporate their respective selective absorptivities to do a time step simulation for the net radiative flux going into and out of the Earth. 

Our report document for this project can be found ![here](./PHYS_203_Final_Project.pdf).
